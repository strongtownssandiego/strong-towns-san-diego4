        Welcome to our website! We are the local chapter of Strong Towns.
        We work to make San Diego stronger economically, build community, and increase resilience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We seek to replace San Diegoâ€™s post-war pattern of development, the Suburban Experiment, with a pattern of development that is financially strong and resilient. We advocate for our city to be safe, livable, and inviting. We work to elevate local government to be the highest level of collaboration for people working together in a place, not merely the lowest level in a hierarchy of governments. We are not partisan. We are inclusive. We are positive.
